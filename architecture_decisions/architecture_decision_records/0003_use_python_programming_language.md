## Context:

The project will use features like REST API calls, data processing, data visualization and website hosting. The team has experience with C, C++, Javascript and Python. The chosen programming language should make it easy to implement the features mentioned above. 

C and C++ are not suitable for this project, because they are not high level languages. It would be hard to implement the features mentioned above in these languages.

Javascript is a high level language, but it is not suitable for this project, because it is not a general purpose programming language. It is mainly used for web development.

Python is a high level general purpose programming language. It is suitable for this project, because it is easy to implement the features mentioned above in Python.

## Decision:

We will use Python as the programming language for this project.

## Consequences:

- The team can extend their knowledge in Python
